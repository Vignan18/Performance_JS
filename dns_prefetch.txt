| Hint             | Purpose                               | When to Use               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **dns-prefetch** | Resolve DNS early                     | Might use a domain        |
| **preconnect**   | DNS + TCP + TLS handshake early       | Will use a domain soon    |
| **prefetch**     | Fetch a resource for *future use*     | Likely needed next page   |
| **preload**      | Fetch a resource *now, high priority* | Critical for current page |

  dns-prefetch = Ask for the address in advance

preconnect = Travel to the house and ring the doorbell early
