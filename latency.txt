1. ‚ö° What is Latency?

Delay between request & response

Initial Request: Higher latency due to:

DNS lookup

TCP handshake

TLS negotiation

Subsequent Requests: Lower latency (persistent connection)

Impact: More requests = more total latency

2. üåê Types of Latency

Network Latency: Delay in data transmission (round-trip time)

Disk Latency: Server delay in responding to a request

3. üõ†Ô∏è Network Throttling (Emulation)

Use Developer Tools ‚Üí Throttling Options:

Emulate slow networks (2G, 3G, etc.)

Simulates: Download speed, upload speed, min latency

Network Type	Download	Upload	Min Latency
GPRS	50 kbps	20 kbps	500 ms
Regular 2G	250 kbps	50 kbps	300 ms
Good 2G	450 kbps	150 kbps	150 ms
Regular 3G	750 kbps	250 kbps	100 ms
Good 3G	1.5 Mbps	750 kbps	40 ms
Regular 4G	4 Mbps	3 Mbps	20 ms
DSL	2 Mbps	1 Mbps	5 ms
Wi-Fi	30 Mbps	15 Mbps	2 ms
4. ‚è±Ô∏è Network Timings (in DevTools)

Blocked: Waiting for connection slot

DNS: Hostname resolution time

Connecting: TCP handshake duration

TLS Handshake: Time to establish secure connection

Sending: Time to send HTTP request

Waiting: Server processing (disk latency)

Receiving: Time to download asset (file size + bandwidth)

5. üìè Measuring Latency

Network Latency: Round trip delay (request + response)

Disk Latency: Time for server to process & send response

6. üéØ Why Reducing Latency Matters

Faster user experience

Better performance on poor connections

Essential for global accessibility
